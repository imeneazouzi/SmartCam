# SmartCam
The Smart Cam project is a cutting-edge solution that combines the power of artificial intelligence and surveillance cameras to provide real-time monitoring of a building's occupants. The AI model will be trained to recognize different objects and people, analyze their movements, and interpret the images captured by the cameras.

One of the most crucial aspects of this project is ensuring the safety of individuals during emergency situations such as fires. By utilizing the Smart Cam technology, the AI model will be able to detect if there are people inside a building during a fire and immediately alert authorities, enabling them to take swift action to ensure everyone's safety.

Additionally, the Smart Cam technology will be useful in monitoring and enforcing health protocols, especially in crowded public places. The AI model will be capable of counting the number of people in a building and ensuring that it does not exceed the allowed limit, thus helping to prevent the spread of infectious diseases.

Another critical application of the Smart Cam technology is in identifying individuals within a building. By analyzing images captured by the surveillance cameras, the AI model can detect and recognize faces, enabling the identification of people present in the building. This capability is particularly useful in security situations and can help law enforcement authorities to track down suspects or persons of interest.

Overall, the Smart Cam project is a groundbreaking solution that has enormous potential in ensuring the safety and security of buildings and their occupants.
